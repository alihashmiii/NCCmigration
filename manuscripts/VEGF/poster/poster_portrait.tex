  \headerbox{Abstract}{name=background,column=0,row=0,span=2}{
	Neural crest cell migration is an important feature of vertebrate development and an emerging system for metastatic invasion. Mechanistic insight into the dynamics of intercellular and cell-microenvironmental interactions underlying this long-distance migration, however, has remained incomplete, particularly in mammalian and closely related avian model systems.
We study how leading and trailing subpopulations of cells are determined in the chick cranial neural crest. These cell subtypes are thought to be induced by different microenvironmental cues and to transmit directional information between each other. We interrogate our hypotheses about the main cue, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), using a combination of \emph{in vivo}, \emph{in vitro} and computational experiments.
First we present a new, simple hypothesis for the phenotypic switching between leader and follower cell behaviour. To test the timescale of this transition, we measure gene expression of neural crest cells over time after removal of and re-exposure to VEGF. These results, in turn, are used to parametrise our model simulations. Next, we test the capacity of exogenous VEGF to change cell type and re-route migration, as well as the effect of removing endogenous VEGF from the lead and trailing subpopulations separately. In each case, we pair \emph{in vivo} experiments with model simulations that implement and test our hypotheses for their ability to produce the observed outcomes. }

\headerbox{Discussion and Conclusion}{name=discussion,column=2,row=0,span=1}{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Neural crest cells grown in culture have different molecular profiles to those in the embryo.
	\item The molecular profiles of neural crest cells in culture respond to changes in VEGF within minutes (Fig.~1-3).
	\item Ectopic sources of VEGF can disrupt stream migration. Trailing cells cluster, lead cells migrate onwards (Fig.~5).
	\item Consistent with our hypothesis and model, VEGF is not necessary for collective migration of trailing cells (Fig.~6).
 	\item[$\rightarrow$] VEGF is one of the embryonic microenvironmental signals guiding migration and driving lead neural crest cell identity.
 \end{itemize}
